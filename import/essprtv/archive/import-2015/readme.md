## Import

The initial version of the dataset was created with a script, with significant support by [Tomasz Żółtak](mailto:t.zoltak@ibe.edu.pl).
Tomasz also added Party Facts IDs to most parties, so that the identification of identical parties across ESS rounds was more easy.

We use two scripts here:
* `ess-extract.R`
  This script extracts all parties of the original ESS datasets (SPSS format) and puts them into `ess-parties.csv`.
  The data is in long format: Each row contains a party in a round.

* `ess-google-sheet.R`
  This script checks if all parties of `ess-parties.csv` occur in a Google Sheet [ESS party list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KN6_jhur5LVHBSZ4Ij5eZHgrL4X4O1W1_Gq55lpC5TU/pub?output=csv) used for clean-up.
  It adds parties to this dataset when they are missing.
  It also does some data cleaning and exports the data into `ess.csv`.
  This data is in wide format: Each row contains a party, with variables containing party names in each round.


## Todo later

 * add size information based on the number of respondents
