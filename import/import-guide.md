Step-by-step import guide -- contribute a dataset
=================================================


Initial version of the codebook was created by Phillip Hocks and Jan
Fischer (University of Bremen) in 2015.
This work was funded by a small research grant of the University of Bremen (M8 Plus).

Introduction
============

We encourage you to participate and contribute to the Party Facts
project by adding party information from your dataset. Through adding
your parties you will be able to link your data with well established
datasets from the political science community.

In Party Facts, we collect and connect information from social science
datasets that cover political parties. We do not include the original
dataset but extract party information and add it to Party Facts where it
can be linked. Ideally, the list of parties includes a party name in the
original language and an English name, some information about the time
the party existed and size information (vote share). Having all this
information makes adding and linking parties through Party Facts easier.

The import and maintenance of data is done via a public Github
repository but the main work of linking parties takes place on the
website. Github is a file provider for software and project development,
which allows us to coordinate, administrate, archive and adapt the
project and datasets perfectly. Github enables you to contribute your
list of parties to the project with a simple upload. The public
repository folder is available at
[github.com/hdigital/partyfactsdata](https://github.com/hdigital/partyfactsdata),
where you can upload your data folder including the required files
mentioned below. Afterwards we will continue the process by importing
your list of parties into the project database at the Party Facts web page.

The list of parties from your dataset has to follow some guidelines.
Before uploading or submitting your dataset, please make sure that the
party list is formatted correctly and follows the points we present
below.


Your Dataset
============

Inclusion criteria
------------------

Every political science dataset dealing with parties and elections may
be added to the Party Facts project.

Smaller parties are removed during the import process (5% or 1% threshold).

Format
------

**Dataset file format**

The datafile should be in csv (comma-separated-value) format. If your
data is currently not, please convert it to a csv file.

**utf-8**

Please make sure your file is utf-8 encoded. Every csv file can be
encoded in utf-8 (save option) and it guarantees an error free display
of string-variables.

Variables
---------

If your dataset contains additional information (eg. party positions,
party leaders etc.) only the respective variables of the Party Facts
project will be imported and displayed. You may exclude additional
variables in the uploaded file.

Your dataset should include the following information:

-   **Country name short** -- Country’s ISO-code, three digit abbreviation of country name.
-   **Name short** -- Common abbreviation of the party name in language of origin.
-   **Name** -- Name in language of origin
-   **Name English** -- Translation of the party name into English
-   **Name other** -- Party name in languages with non-latin letters
-   **Year first** -- Foundation of the party. If no information is available, the first election occurrence may be entered
-   **Year last** -- Dissolution of the party. If no information is available, the last election occurrence may be entered. Leave empty if the party exists as of today.
-   **Share** -- Vote share won in a national general election used to identify the party. Use maximum vote share if information is available. The decimal place is indicated by a dot and not a comma
-   **Share year** -- Year of vote share inserted at “share”

Strictly required are *country* and *party name* information.

Your Script
-----------

In Party Facts, we import a list of parties extracted from a dataset.
Ideally, you provide a script in which the party list is extracted from
the dataset including the information needed for a Party Facts import.
Smaller parties are removed with the script (5% or 1% threshold).
We prefer R scripts but Stata or other scripts may work as well.

The script helps to understand the origin of the party list and allows
us to solve potential problems.

Readme file
-----------

To provide information about the dataset it is important to submit a
*readme* file together with your dataset. This readme file will be used
as an information source on Github and the information displayed on the
Party Facts website.

For a consistent workflow and information, please make sure your readme
file matches the following criteria:

**Name: readme.md (markdown)**

This is a markdown file which can be either created directly in Github
or via the text editor

**Template**

Please provide the Readme file in the following style.

```Markdown
## Source

 * (...) reference in APSA style


## Credits (optional)

 * (...) name -- institution -- year(s)


## Import

 * (...) short description of data preparation pipeline


## Comments (optional)

 * (...)


## Todo later -- (optional)

 * (...)

```

Upload
======

To import your party list, you need to create a folder with the
respective files. The folder has to be named with a single word
identifying your data or project.

The folder needs to contain:

-   Data file -- named with the same word as the folder .csv
-   Readme file -- *readme.md*
-   Script file -- extracting party information for Party Facts import

The folder may contain your original dataset. The dataset can be ignored
in Github if it includes information required to run the script but
should not be published on the Party Facts Github page. In this case,
please provide the dataset with the name *source\_\_*filename (two
underscores). Files and folders starting with *‘source\_\_’* will be
ignored in Github and thus not be available publicly.

You can either upload the file directly on the public Github repository
yourself or send it to one of the project maintainers -- Holger Döring
or Sven Regel.


Import to partyfacts.org
============================

The import into the Party Facts website is done by the Party Facts Team.
Afterwards you are ready to link your dataset to the existing core
parties and to combine your data with party information from many
existing sources.
