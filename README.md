## Summary

The [Party Facts project](https://partyfacts.org/) aims to offer a gateway to empirical data about political parties and provides a modern online almanac about parties and their history as recorded in social science datasets. The many existing datasets with crucial information gained through expert or mass surveys, data handbooks, voting records, party positions or electoral results about political parties are difficult to link and there is the need for an infrastructure that helps combining existing sources. With Party Facts we want to establish an infrastructure that supports political scientists in linking parties across datasets. In the Party Facts project we link core datasets of political science and provide a platform for other scientists to add party keys from additional datasets.The project uses modern online technologies to offer an opportunity for collaborative data collection. Scientists can add missing links between parties, can validate links and are given the opportunity to provide additional information about parties and their history.
